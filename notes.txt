These are notes of the git-svn research.
First I've created an svn repo in a personal free Assembla account.
It was created with a trunk directory automatically.
I created and committed tags and branches directories.

The checkout command is:

svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/git-svn-sandbox/trunk git-svn-sandbox

----

Then I created a git-sandbox directory that was a git svn clone of that svn repo:

git svn clone https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/git-svn-sandbox/trunk git-sandbox

I added this text.  Still on the master branch, I will now commit to git.

----

Now I'll add this line, git commit -a, git svn rebase (should have no effect), and
then git svn dcommit.

----

git svn info:

{[master] ± }: git svn info                                                                                                                                                                                                 26.Mar.11 15Path: .

... and git remote -v produces no output, showing that the svn repo is not considered a remote branch.

----

I got this when doing a git svn rebase without committing local changes:

{[master] ± }: git svn rebase                                                                                       notes.txt: needs update
update-index --refresh: command returned error: 1

Now I'll add a remote of this repo on my Github account:
git remote add origin git@github.com:keithrbennett/git-sandbox.git

I'll commit this text locally, then push to github and dcommit to svn. 

----

That worked.  But what is the meaning of the Github repo?
Is it just backup for the local repo?
Others could clone it.
Others could point to it as their remote.  Hmmm, let's try that.

----

I just created a new Github account, "kblmn", whose email address is "keithrbennett.lmn@gmail.com".
I also created a "kblmn" user account on my Ubuntu VM, and did the global git config for it.
Now I will clone the repo on keithrbennett's Github account:

kblmn@ubuntu:~$ mkdir work
kblmn@ubuntu:~$ cd work
kblmn@ubuntu:~/work$ git clone git@github.com:keithrbennett/git-sandbox.git

Hmmm, I guess I needed to set up a public key and upload it to Github:

kblmn@ubuntu:~$ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Let's try the git clone again:

kblmn@ubuntu:~/work$ git clone git@github.com:keithrbennett/git-sandbox.git

Success!

=======

Hello, from kblmn on Ubuntu.  I am the second user, and will commit changes to my local repo,
and then push them to the central repo on keithrbennett's Github account.

====

That didn't work too well.  I forgot that I had to add kblmn as a collaborator
on the Github repo.  On the keithrbennett Github page I selected "Admin",
then "Collaborators", then added "kblmn".

====

Uh-oh... this happened on the Ubuntu VM:

kblmn@ubuntu:~/work/git-sandbox$ git svn rebase
Migrating from a git-svn v1 layout...
Data from a previous version of git-svn exists, but
	.git/svn
	(required for this version (1.7.1) of git-svn) does not exist.
Done migrating from a git-svn v1 layout
Unable to determine upstream SVN information from working tree history

It looks like the Mac version of git-svn is older (v1) than Ubuntu's (v1.7.1).

Come to think of it, would we even want multiple users rebasing?
