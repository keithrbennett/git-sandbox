These are notes of the git-svn research.
First I've created an svn repo in a personal free Assembla account.
It was created with a trunk directory automatically.
I created and committed tags and branches directories.

The checkout command is:

svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/git-svn-sandbox/trunk git-svn-sandbox
