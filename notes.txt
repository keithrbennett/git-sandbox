These are notes of the git-svn research.
First I've created an svn repo in a personal free Assembla account.
It was created with a trunk directory automatically.
I created and committed tags and branches directories.

The checkout command is:

svn co https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/git-svn-sandbox/trunk git-svn-sandbox

----

Then I created a git-sandbox directory that was a git svn clone of that svn repo:

git svn clone https://subversion.assembla.com/svn/git-svn-sandbox/trunk git-sandbox

I added this text.  Still on the master branch, I will now commit to git.

----

Now I'll add this line, git commit -a, git svn rebase (should have no effect), and
then git svn dcommit.
